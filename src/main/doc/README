Splunk logger for CraftBukkit Minecraft 0.8

The Splunk logger for CraftBukkit Minecraft provides additional logging
functionality to the CraftBukkit Minecraft server. The logs are written
to the console and the Minecraft server log, and to any number of Splunk
TCP input ports declared in config.yml.

The messages conform to Splunk's logging best practices:

INSTALLATION

Copy the log_to_splunk_plugin-0.8.jar to your CraftBukkit's plugins/ directory,
and create a directory plugins/LogToSplunk. In that directory write a config.yml
file specifying what Splunk TCP ports to log to, e.g.,

splunks: localhost:10000, mc.splunk.local:10000, pq.5f.as.23:111

Then start your CraftBukkit server or, if it is already running, run the command
'reload' in the server console.
